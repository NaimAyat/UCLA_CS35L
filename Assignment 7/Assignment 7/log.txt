CS 35L Assignment 7
Laboratory: SSH setup and use in applications
May 20, 2017

I began the lab server-side. 

First, I downloaded the required openssh files (openssh-server and openssh-client) with
	dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Then, I generated public and private key pairs with
	ssh-keygen

I continued my server set up by adding my partner with
	sudo useradd -d /home/partnerName -m partnerName
and set the password with
	sudo passwd partnerName

I entered the new directory with
	cd /home/partnerName

I set up an ssh directory to store key information with
	sudo mkdir .ssh

Finally, I gave my partner ownership of the ssh directory:
	sudo chown -R partnerName .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then transitioned to the client-side.

First, my partner used
	ifconfig
to retrieve his IP address, which I will henceforth denote by IPaddress.

Then I added my public key to the ssh folder with
	ssh-copy-id -i naim@IPaddress
and added the server password to the ssh folder so I won't need to manually type it:
	ssh-add

Then I did
	ssh naim@IPaddress 
to enter my partner's server.

As a test, I tried 
	touch NaimFile
to ensure that I can add a file to the server.

Finally, I logged into the server with execute permissions:
	ssh -X naim@IPaddress

I tried to open an internet browser with the command
	firefox
and was successful.
