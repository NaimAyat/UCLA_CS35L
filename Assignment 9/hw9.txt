Homework: Change Management

2.) I created a new branch of the Diffutils v3.0 directory with
	git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.) I installed my change into the new branch by running
	patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 

4.) I learned that the Emacs add-change-log-entry-other-window  command (C-x 4 a) adds a 
    new entry to the ChangeLog file for the file currently being edited.

5.) I opened emacs and did (C-x 4 a) to create such a ChangeLog entry.

6.) To commit the changes to the new branch, I did
	git commit -aF ChangeLog
    and ensured it was adapted from the original patch.

7.) To generate a new formatted patch file, I did
	git-format patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.) To create a new branch called "partner", I did
	git checkout v3.0 -b partner
    To apply my partner's patch, I did
	git am partner-formatted-patch.txt
    To build it, I ran
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
    To ensure that it works, I did
	src/diff . -
	src/diff --help
    And ensured that all apostrophes were properly formatted.

9.) To verify that my ChangeLog entry works, I did
	make distdir
    Which created a new directory containing my partner's patch.
    I then entered it to observe the ChangeLog, ensuring that it 
    is the same as my partner's.

10.) I installed Xming for windows and configured it for use with PuTTy.
     I ran the commands
	cd ~eggert/scr/gnu/emacs
	gitk
     And took a screenshot of the window that opened as a result.
