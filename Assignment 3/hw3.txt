Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

Q1: No, it was not necessary to remove the line 
"case_long_iso_time_style:". In the original code,
this line was actually a duplicate of another case
in a switch statement. The first occurence of this
line would have picked up the case if it were to
occur, meaning that the duplicate line would never
actually be reached. Brady simply removed an 
unnecessary line to clean up the code.

Q2: If we have other software that is accustomed to
reading dates in the Year-Month-Day format, then we'd
have to rewrite that other software to account for the
sudden change to a Month/Day/Year format. This could
be especially problematic if our company operated 
internationally, since the new format is certainly
not the global standard.

Q3: Calling randline.py on an empty (null) file returns
the error message:
	IndexError: list index out of range.
This is because the script assumes that the input file
has some sort of content. Line 274 of the script says:
	return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
	# raises IndexError if seq is empty.
Therefore, the error message occurs because randline.py 
attempts to index the file but is not able to.

Q4: Python 3 automatically unpacks tuples, so passing
the parameters (errno, strerror) as an exception
in line 65 returns a syntax error. To fix this,
we could instead pass in a single parameter: 
a list containing both errno and strerror.
