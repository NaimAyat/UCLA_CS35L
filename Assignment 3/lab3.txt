Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

I need to try Brady's workaround for the Coreutils
date problem.

I execute the commands
	wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
	tar -xvzf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to download Coreutils 7.6 and "un-tar" it.

Then I do 
	cd coreutils-7.6
	to enter the Coreutils directory and
	emacs INSTALL
to read the installation instructions.

Now I do 
	./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/naim/coreutils-install
to configure a directory for my Coreutils installation.

The filesystem is ready for installation, so I can do
	make
	make install
to install Coreutils in the aforementioned directory.

Now I do 
	cd /u/cs/ugrad/naim/coreutils-install
	ls
to check that Coreutils installed correctly.

I enter the Coreutils bin directory with
	cd /u/cs/ugrad/naim/coreutils-install/bin 
and execute
	export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
	./ls -l 
to check if I get the YYYY-MM-DD date instead of the
traditional Unix date, which I do.

Therefore, we must patch the date formatting problem.

I use
	cd ..
to return to the coreutils-install directory.

Now I execute
	emacs bradyPatch
and copy the text from Brady's patch into this file.

I execute
	patch -p1 < bradyPatch
to patch the date problem.

Now I do 
	make
which re-makes a verson of coreutils with the patch.

I return to the ~ directory with 
	cd ~

To test the patch, I do
	./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
which returns the current date in the proper Unix 
format, Month/Day/Year.

Now I do
	touch -t 198801010100 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to change the date on the file to Jan 1, 1988.

Again, I do 
	./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
which returns the Jan 1, 1988 date in the proper
Unix format, Month/Day/Year.

Finally, I check that the unpatched ls funtion
still exists in bin and returns the incorrect
date format by doing
	./coreutils-install/bin/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
As expected, this returns the Jan 1, 1998 date in 
the problematic format, Year-Month-Date.

We've successfully patched the Coreutils ls function.
The new ls function exists in 
/coreutils-7.6/src
and the old ls function exists in
/coreutils-install/bin.
